# Introduction

This repo demonstrates basic examples of Linux device driver development for
the purpose of study and sharing.

Most of the examples are excepted from the LDD3 (Linux Device Drivers, Third
Edition), you can find an online copy [HERE](https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/).
However, due to the old age of this book, some hardware devices, i.e 
parallel port, are rarely seen in nowadays computer, and some kernel APIs
have varied a lot apart from kernel 2.6. So I modify some examples to best
suit for cutting edge hardwares.
